# ArtifactManager

This is my second project i made in c# during my 4th study semester.

I'd never make anything like this again but it was pretty nice as a second big project with UI.

I was kinda proud of myself back then :D

The goal of the project was to make system that allows users to create relations between objects add them specified fields and create instances.

It might be useful for example during developing a game, skeleton of classes would be generated automatically just after responsible person created them using given tools.
